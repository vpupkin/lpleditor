Initial goal to writing this plugin - fix the problem with original [APT](http://apteditor.sourceforge.net/) which not works on my version of Eclipse.

So -after short searching for alternative or at least sourcecode for plugin above the WIKI gave me a lot of [ideas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language) ...
...and the project is here...
...with `unique` name....
...yep.

# YEP APT - A`lmost`P`lain`T`ext` Editor #
## is an Eclipse plugin ##
### that can be used to edit and preview APT (Almost Plain Text) files. ###

its looks very similar with "father":::

The rest is in download-tab.

v.1.0.0 - first version with "repaired" original APT-converted.

v.2.0.0 - this version use DOXIA in respect with latest maven-site-renderer engine,
